# Riff â€“ Trailer Page for RIFF

I created a custom GPT that roasts my perfectionism paralysis and turns overthinking into action.  
This trailer page was built to let people experience her tone in a quick, playful way.

Itâ€™s a completely personal project and a creative experimentâ€”part design study, part self-intervention.

ðŸ§  Built as a personal tool and creative UX experiment by [@kreaseda](https://instagram.com/kreaseda),  
Riff lives to interrupt resistance and push messy action over polished delay.
